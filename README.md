# FEM Truss Solver

## Project Description
The FEM Truss Solver is a Flask-based web application developed as part of a mechanical engineering senior project at Kasetsart University. It serves as a finite element method (FEM) 2D truss analysis solver, designed to assist engineers in performing finite element analysis (FEA) calculations on truss structures. The application provides a user-friendly interface to input truss parameters, visualize truss structures, calculate deformations, and analyze stresses.

## Features
- **Truss Structure Visualization:** Plot and visualize 2D truss structures based on user input.
- **Finite Element Analysis:** Perform FEM analysis to calculate deformations, nodal displacements, reactions at supports, and stresses in each truss element.
- **Interactive Interface:** Input truss data, view results, and export data for further analysis.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Input Truss Parameters:**
   - Enter the number of elements and nodes.
   - Provide the coordinates for each node.
   - Specify the local destination array (LDA) to define element connectivity.
   - Input nodal forces and support conditions.

2. **Visualize Truss Structure:**
   - Click "Submit" to plot the truss structure.

3. **Perform FEM Analysis:**
   - Enter material properties (Young's modulus and cross-sectional area).
   - Click "Calculate" to compute displacements, reactions, and stresses.
   - View the deformed truss structure and stress distribution.

4. **Access Results:**
   - Review calculated nodal displacements, reaction forces, and stresses.
   - Export results for further analysis if needed.
